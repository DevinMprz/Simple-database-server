# Simple database server
**Simple data server program, which can store and retrieve data from a file**

# Visual representation of the data structure in the file

So basically data are stored in Map<String List<String>> structure. The key is the name of the table and the value is the list of values in the table.


| Table 1 | Table 2 | Table 3 | ...     |
|---------| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Value 1 | Value 1 | Value 1 | ...     |
| Value 2 | Value 2 | Value 2 | ...     |
| Value 3 | Value 3 | Value 3 | ...     |
| ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |

# Plans on future improvements


- More advanced data storage
- GUI for the server
- Graphical representation of the data
- Graphical representation of statistics (memory, load, connections, etc.)
- Probably something with the web
- Need to think of something special to add to the project :)
